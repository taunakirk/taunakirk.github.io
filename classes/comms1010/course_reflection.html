            <h2>Communications 1010 GE Signature Assignment</h2>

            <h3 class="assignment-question">Based on the assessments, what are your strengths as a communicator?</h3>
            <p>
                My strengths as a communicator include public speaking, participating in group discussions, and
                communicating in meetings. I used to be in a church when I lived in North Idaho. My job in the
                church was to be an evangelist, I was to meet random people on campus and engage in conversation and
                eventually invite them to a house gathering we hosted every week. I had to learn how to communicate
                effectively and also listen effectively. It was very hard for me to get to the point of expressing
                what I believed in and the confidence to say it to strangers even with the possibility of judgment.
                I did end up leaving the religion but I really appreciate the communication skills I gained while I
                was in it. I learned to talk to someone and listen to them respond back and find common ground.
                After talking to someone and engaging in friendship, those people always gave feedback that they
                were more open to talk to me based on how I engaged in conversation instead of just feeding them
                information.
            </p>

            <p>
                I took that skill into my workplace. Whether I am in meetings or having a discussion
                with an engineer, I always found that the target of the conversation is finding common ground as we
                were trying to solve a problem. It didn’t help if we had different ideas and were strung on those
                ideas but that we would compromise on our ideas. Everytime we communicated like this at work we
                found that our work relationships grew and the confidence to express our thoughts and ideas became
                second nature to us.
            </p>

            <h3 class="assignment-question">Based on the assessments, what are your weaknesses? What can you do to start improving your
                communication competence now?
            </h3>
            <p>
                I found that my weaknesses were speeches. I can talk well in a public setting when there is a group and
                they engage in the speech I am giving. The weakness was if I am giving a speech with no feedback or
                input on the topic I was talking about. I find that I get nervous depending on how nervous I am showing.
                It is not the speech itself I am nervous about but how others perceive how nervous I look. I believe
                this is a root insecurity of mine based on past trauma. I am more worried about how others perceive me
                and then I try really hard to not look like that. It tends to make me look even more nervous or stumble
                on my speech because I am focusing more on how I look and not the speech itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think to improve
                on this is to not think about what others think of me. I am the one giving the speech, I should be
                focused on the words I am going to say. I believe it is a major mind game I play to myself. I need to be
                able to change the thoughts I have to confidence in what I am saying. I am not one hundred percent on
                how to improve this, I am in therapy working on it so I hope that it will help me cope in the moments of
                me giving a speech.
            </p>

            <h3 class="assignment-question">What do you think has most impacted your perception of others? Think about your culture, family,
                and social influences. Based on what you have learned about perception of others, choose one
                concept you plan to improve on moving forward? (impression management; cognitive complexity;
                attribution error; etc from Chapter 2.2)</h3>
            <p>
                The impact of my perception of others is always thinking of the innocence or the positive of that
                individual. I grew up in a household where my parents were verbally judging people in their lives or
                strangers. I always felt negative in those moments and I really did not like it. As someone who has gone
                through a lot of trauma and hardships I tend to see the positive in people or rather hope to see the
                positive of them. Sometimes I perceive someone who has good intentions and get into a situation where my
                safety is at risk. This is the “Halo Effect”. A nice smile from a stranger and I think, “Oh they must be
                a kind person.” It allows me to not feel on edge all the time but also brings naivety into my head.
            </p>
            <p>
                I
                have been in situations where I would be walking home at night and see a man walking with a pack and no
                shoes and I perceive them as someone who is having a hard time and I feel empathy for them. They will
                then “cat call” me or be really suspicious to me and then I have to go to survival mode quickly. I plan
                on improving having a neutral perception of others specifically in already risky situations.
            </p>

            <h3 class="assignment-question">What do you think has most impacted your perception of self and/or self-presentation? Think
                about your culture, family, and social influences. Based on what you have learned about
                perception of self, choose one concept you plan to improve on moving forward? (ethical
                communication; influences on self perception; self-presentation; self-efficacy; etc. from
                Chapter 2.3)
            </h3>
            <p>
                The thing that most impacted on my perception of self is specifically the trauma I endured growing up in
                my family and the church I used to attend. I grew up where I was the “bad” child. Words or threats like
                “if you keep acting like this we will have to send you away” or “look at your sister, she listens and is
                a good girl.” Going through therapy I learned these were lies or threats because my parents didn’t want
                to fully understand me or the reasons for my actions. I wish I could say my perception of self changed
                for the positive but it continues to be negative. I try very hard on first impressions or in
                relationships to be the most kind, non-self- serving, or the most positive person. I have found this to
                be very tiring as sometimes I don't feel good mentally or physically and I lie to myself to make sure
                and preserve the positive side people perceive of me.
            </p>
            <p>
                I want to improve on this. I want to come off
                as natural or honest to others. I want to perceive how the other party is interacting and match what
                they are communicating. Instead of just making sure they get a perfect perception of me, I want them to
                honestly be able to perceive me based on the communication between us with honesty.
            </p>
            <h3 class="assignment-question">As you know, communication is irreversible and it shapes human identity and society.
                Knowing this, how can you adapt verbal and nonverbal messages for effectiveness while
                also not crossing the ethical line? How does gender, diversity, power, privilege, race,
                etc. impact this question of ethics? Could one person cross the line, but not another in
                the same situation? Use these questions to reflect on verbal and nonverbal messages and
                their ethical usage in your response.
            </h3>
            <p>
                I think some good ways of communicating effectively could be eye contact. When communicating eye contact
                is very important and tells the other party that you are listening to what they are saying with
                nonverbal cues. I think also mirroring body language shows the communicator that the listener is paying
                attention to them and this allows the communicator to feel comfortable. I think it's important to
                recognize that the ethics of communication is not practiced in a vacuum but filtered through social
                hierarchies. Those with higher social or organizational power have a greater burden to mind their
                “volume”. For example, a casual suggestion by a CEO could feel like a command to an intern. Ethical
                communication requires active-space making.
            </p>
            <p>
                When it comes to gender and race the factors of ethical
                communication influences how messages are perceived regardless of their intent. When a man verbally
                communicates with an assertive tone it is often rewarded but when a woman uses assertive communication
                she is labeled as “aggressive”. To be ethical, I must acknowledge the biases. An ethical communicator
                recognizes their “blind spots” and avoids using microaggressions that reinforce the systemic
                inequalities. I do believe that one person can cross the line but not another in the same situation. An
                example would be if a person is using a term of endearment specific to their own racial or cultural
                community, they are participating in identity-building and solidarity. You take another person who is an
                outsider of that community and they use the same term they are seen as engaging in cultural
                appropriation or mockery. This is not a double standard but it's a recognition that identity grants or
                denies permission for certain types of communication.
