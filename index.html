                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Tauna Kirk and I am currently pursuing my Mechanical Engineering degree at Salt Lake Community College. I will graduate with my associates at SLCC and then transfer to the University of Utah and finish with my Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering. I currently work at Black Diamond as a Quality Assurance Technician. I test all products that Black Diamond manufactures for quality such as durability, appearance, and performance.

                <p>
                    I partake in quite a few hobby’s when I have the time away from full time school and work. I enjoy hiking, camping, fishing, and reading. I am my car’s lifeline. I have replaced spark plugs, coolant hoses, air filters, and my car's mass airflow sensor. I also enjoy climbing. I am currently working on 5.10b on top rope. I plan on pursuing lead climbing and more exposure to outdoor climbing. I enjoy watching movies and solving mechanical problems with my boyfriend. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have been exposed to manufacturing and engineering for about 8 years. I enjoyed the hands-on work approach and the problem solving with machines. I have a career desire that I hope to pursue once I am at the University of Utah. I want to use mechanical engineering to recreate prehistoric life, more importantly, dinosaurs. I want to take what paleontologists have found and create a skeleton, muscle, and skin to create the dinosaur or organism. From there I would biomechanically solve questions or theories on how that organism ate, walked, flew, swam, etc. I foresee that future technologies will unlock new creative possibilities, and I look forward to shaping those advances.
